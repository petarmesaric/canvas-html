                    <p>Canvas LMS is rapidly becoming one of the most valuable educational tools. This Learning Management System that has a revolutionary easy to use interface and amazing features for traditional and new ways of learning, comes in two different flavors. First one is an Instructure hosted cloud service. However, as this is an Open Source software, it is possible also to install it on your own server for free.</p>

                    <h3>WHY THE SECOND OPTION IS NOT SO COMMON?</h3>

                    <p>Because the installation and configuration of the software is not easy, not well documented, and requires significant expertise. Some of the interesting features like media recordings, live webinars and similar, depend also on the third party Open Source software (like Kaltura, BigBlueButton, etc) which is also hard to install and configure to work with Canvas LMS. There are few bits of functionality that are not released as Open Source (Attendance module –Roll Call, Mobile applications for iOS and Android and Chat module) and therefore can’t be used with community version of Canvas LMS. You don’t have any support.</p>

                    <p class="lead">
                    If you don’t have a budget to afford Cloud hosted Canvas LMS for your University, High School or Company, or you like to have your data on a private server with full control, we can help you with the following services:
